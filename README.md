# smart-cart

**Hey!**  
Iâ€™m working on my first embedded software project â€“ a **Smart Cart** aimed at reducing manpower and creating a smoother shopping experience.

### ðŸ”§ Components Used:
- Arduino
- ESP32
- OLED Display
- LED
- LM2596 (Buck Converter)
- RFID

### ðŸ’» Software Required:
- Arduino IDE
- Visual Studio Code

Itâ€™s going great so far â€“ Iâ€™ve faced hurdles, made mistakes, and even used extra hardware, but honestly, it's a fun and rewarding way to learn.  
Iâ€™ll also be attaching the codes I used throughout the process. Stay tuned for updates!

*Would love any feedback or suggestions on how to improve â€“ open to learning and making this project even better!*
