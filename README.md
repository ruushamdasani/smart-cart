# smart-cart

**Hey!**  
I’m working on my first embedded software project – a **Smart Cart** aimed at reducing manpower and creating a smoother shopping experience.

### Components Used:
- ESP32
- OLED Display
- LED
- RFID SCAN AND TAGS 

### Software Required:
- Arduino IDE

  
It’s going great so far – I’ve faced hurdles, made mistakes, and even used extra hardware, but honestly, it's a fun and rewarding way to learn.  
I’ll also be attaching the codes I used throughout the process.
